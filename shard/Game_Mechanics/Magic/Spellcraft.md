## **Mage Skill System & Spellcrafting Guide**

### **1. Base Elements:**
These are the primary components of any spell. They determine the core nature of the spell.
- **Air:** Mobility, control, swift attacks.
- **Earth:** Defense, control, heavy attacks.
- **Fire:** Offense, area damage.
- **Water:** Control, defense, utility.
- **Soul:** Utility, healing, unique effects.

### **2. Modifiers:**
Modifiers tweak the behavior, power, or duration of the base element. The intensity of these modifiers is influenced by the amount of mana channeled into the spell.

- **Intensity Modifiers:** Amplify the power or scale of the spell. More mana = more power.
- **Duration Modifiers:** Extend or reduce the duration of effects. More mana = longer duration.
- **Area Modifiers:** Expand or narrow the area of effect for spells. More mana = larger area.
- **Utility Modifiers:** Add secondary effects or behaviors. More mana = stronger secondary effects.

### **3. Catalysts:**
These are special ingredients that can enhance, redirect, or add unique properties to the spell.
- **Crystals:** Enhance power, add unique effects.
- **Herbs:** Modify properties, add utility effects.
- **Runes:** Define shape, trajectory, or special behavior.

### **Spellcrafting:**

**Crafting a Spell:**

1. **Choose a Base Element:** This determines the core nature of your spell.
2. **Apply Modifiers:** These will tweak the behavior of your base element. You can add multiple modifiers, but there might be a limit based on the mage's skill level.
3. **Introduce a Catalyst:** This will add a unique twist or enhancement to your spell. Some catalysts might be rare and can produce unexpected results.

**Charging Spells:**

- Spells can be charged by holding down the casting button. The longer you charge, the more mana is channeled into the spell, enhancing its modifiers.
- Catalysts can further influence these modifiers, adding unique effects or amplifying existing ones.

**Spell Outcome:**

The outcome of the spell is a combination of the chosen Base Element, Modifiers, and Catalyst. For example:

- **Base Element:** Fire
- **Modifiers:** Intensity (high), Duration (long)
- **Catalyst:** Herb (adds a smokescreen effect)

**Result:** A powerful fire spell that burns intensely and for an extended period, also producing a smokescreen that obscures vision.
