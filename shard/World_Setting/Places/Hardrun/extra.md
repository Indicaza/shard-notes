**Architecture and Defenses:**
As a mountain fortress, Hardrun is a marvel of both ancient engineering and modern fortifications.

Beyond this formidable entrance, the stepped structure of Hardrun allows for multiple defensive platforms, each wall embedded with Archanite-infused turrets that can be activated in times of siege.

The forges of Hardrun are famed for their quality, producing both sturdy gear for the miners and exquisite weaponry for adventurers. Crafting is a core part of life in Hardrun, and players will learn the fundamentals of the game's crafting system through interactive quests and apprenticeships with master blacksmiths.
