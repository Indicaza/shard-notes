## **The Dawn of the Universe**

In the beginning, a portal from an alternate dimension unleashed a cataclysmic event known as 'The Big Bang.' From its chaotic aftermath, the **Shards** emerged. These ancient spacecraft, designed to harness the power of stars, navigated the cosmos with a singular mission: to seed life. By creating meteors infused with the perfect mixture of biomass and elements, they aimed to ensure the continuity of consciousness, even as universes perished and new ones were born.

## **The Legacy of the Shards**

As the Shards journeyed through the universe, they were soon accompanied by vast alien fleets. Many of these extraterrestrial beings owed their existence to the Shards, having been seeded on barren planets. These spacefaring races, recognizing their celestial benefactors, followed the Shards, hoping to discover a means to escape the inevitable end of their respective universes.

## **The Forgotten World**

Players awaken on a medieval planet, a relic of its former self. Once a bustling intergalactic trade hub, it now stands as a testament to a forgotten catastrophe. The inhabitants, though diverse in culture and magic, are oblivious to their astral heritage. Their history is fragmented, and memories of their illustrious past are but faint echoes.

## **The Underworld and the Revenants**

Beneath the planet's crust lie vast underground caverns, known to the surface dwellers as the 'Underworld' and to its denizens as the 'Twilight Abyss.' Here, various alien races found refuge from the planet's tumultuous past. Among them are the **Revenants**, 3D-printed clones created by the Shards. Infused with a persistent consciousness, these beings were designed to maintain universal balance. However, a glitch in their creation left them amnesiac, unaware of their past lives and grand purpose. Despite their memory loss, the Revenants possess unique abilities that set them apart, making them formidable entities in this world.

## **The Quest for Truth**

As players delve into this high-fantasy realm, they realize that their world's surface is but a facade. To uncover their true purpose and the intricate designs of the Shards and Revenants, they must journey deep into the Twilight Abyss.

## **The Shadow of Asmoday**

Yet, the abyss is not without peril. Lurking in its depths is **Asmoday**, a malevolent being with a sinister agenda. Intent on harnessing the Revenants' power, Asmoday seeks to corrupt them, aiming to ascend to godhood and dominate all of creation.

## **The Fate of the Universe**

Embarking on an epic quest, players will face formidable foes, unearth ancient technologies, and confront the very fabric of the universe. The destiny of their world and the cosmos at large teeters on the brink. Their actions will determine the future of all existence.
