"The Shard" is a procedural fantasy MMO set in an ancient universe where magic and technology are inextricably linked.  As a Revenant, you have transcended death through a process that digitizes consciousness and then implants it into cloned avatars, allowing you a much-needed edge in the battles to come.  Bring balance to the planet of Arcadia and reconnect with your astral heritage.

To grow in power the players must navigate procedural dungeons to reap unique rewards.  Craft unique gear by combining various ingredients and utilizing your knowledge of both magic and technology, all while uncovering the secrets behind your own existence and the origins of the universe. Will you rise to the challenge and bring balance to a chaotic world? The fate of Arcadia - and perhaps even the cosmos - is in your hands.
