Carpentry is the art of constructing and customizing structures, from simple huts to grand castles. With the right materials, blueprints, and tools, players can craft their dream homes and even share them with the community.

## Key Components:

1. **Materials:** Depending on the region, players can gather different types of materials. Forests might offer a variety of woods, while quarries could provide diverse stones. The availability and type of material can influence the aesthetics and functionality of the crafted structure.

2. **Blueprints:** Blueprints are essential for crafting specific structures. They can be:
   - Purchased from vendors.
   - Acquired as drops from various sources.
   - Created by high-level craftsmen. However, creating a blueprint deducts experience points from the craftsman, symbolizing the transfer of knowledge.

3. **Building Process:** Players will enter an editor mode with specialized camera controls to design their structure. Once satisfied, they can initiate the building process. The time taken depends on the blueprint quality and the skill of the AI workers.

4. **Tools:** Carpentry requires specific tools, including drafting tools, which can influence the precision and quality of the construction.

5. **Upgrade and Customization:** Players can re-draft and remodel their structures. The editor allows customization of colors, textures, and models, ensuring each structure is unique.

6. **Size and Design:** Initially, the size and design are primarily aesthetic choices, allowing players to express their creativity.

7. **Building Location:** While the region's aesthetic is the primary consideration, the proximity to neighbors can influence a player's experience.

8. **Building Restrictions:** To maintain a respectful and immersive environment, certain designs might be restricted. A potential voting system could allow the community to provide feedback on structures, with highly downvoted designs reverting to a default appearance.

9. **Building Community:** Guilds can acquire land, construct communal structures like castles, and offer player housing within or around their protective walls.

## Materials:

1. **Wood:** A versatile material used in most structures. Different forests provide various types of wood, each with unique properties and aesthetics.
   
2. **Stone:** Primarily used for aesthetic purposes, different quarries offer diverse stones, allowing players to customize the look of their structures.
   
5. **Metal:** While we have detailed information on metals, they play a crucial role in crafting specific structural elements.
   
6. **Clay, Straw, Glass, Mortar, Plaster, Paint, and Carpet:** These are secondary materials, essential for finishing touches. They can be easily purchased from NPCs or gathered.

# Wood Object Shape

**Wood Type:** Description of the specific type of wood.

**Density:** A measure of mass per unit of volume. Determines the heaviness of the wood. This can affect the weight and balance of weapons, especially bows.

**Hardness:** A measure of the wood's resistance to deformation or scratching. Crucial for weapon durability, especially for the hilt and sheath.

**Tensile Strength:** A measure of the wood's ability to withstand tension without breaking. Highly important for bows as they are subjected to tension when drawn.

**Thermal Conductivity:** A measure of the wood's ability to conduct heat. While not directly related to weapon crafting, it can play a role in environments where temperature is a factor.

**Workability:** A measure of how easy it is to work with the wood using tools. Important for crafting intricate weapon designs and fittings.

**Shock Resistance:** A measure of the wood's ability to absorb impact without breaking or splintering. Important for hilts, shields, and other items that might receive direct blows.

**Common Uses:** Typical applications or products made from this type of wood.
