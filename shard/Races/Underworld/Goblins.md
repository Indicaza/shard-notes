-   Living in the Twilight Abyss would likely be harsh and difficult for goblins. They would have to contend with limited resources, dangerous creatures, and hostile environments. This would likely lead to a goblin society that is highly competitive and aggressive, with a strong emphasis on the survival of the fittest.
-   Goblins would likely have to adapt to the unique challenges of life in the Abyss. They would need to develop ways to find food and shelter in the dark, underground caverns. They might also have to find ways to defend themselves from other Underdark creatures, such as giant spiders and giant bats.
-   Goblins would be likely to form small, tight-knit communities, as a means of survival. These communities could be led by a powerful goblin leader, who would have a mix of strength and cunning to rule the group.
-   Goblins would have to develop ways to communicate in the dark and may have evolved some sort of echolocation or other means of sensing their surroundings.
-   They could have developed a complex system of trade and barter since resources are scarce in the Underdark, and this would be key to their survival.
-   Goblins would likely have developed a unique culture, with its own set of beliefs, customs, and traditions. They could have a religion that venerates the Underworld or certain powerful creatures that live there. They could also have their own language, customs, and traditions.

Keep in mind that this is all fictional, and you can adjust and develop the goblin culture and society as you see fit to match the lore and atmosphere of your game. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

can you expound on how they trade and what they craft well? I'm thinking they have a tentative relationship with other sentient creatures in the Underdark.

Sure, I can expound on how the goblins trade and what they craft well in the Underdark. Here are a few ideas to consider:

-   The goblins in your Underdark would likely have a tentative relationship with other sentient creatures in the Underdark, since resources are scarce. They would likely engage in trade and barter with other Underdark dwellers such as drow, duergars, and other subterranean races.
-   Goblins may have a good eye for valuable materials and could be adept at finding and mining precious metals, gems, and other resources. They may also have a good understanding of geology and the underground, which would help them locate new resources.
-   They could craft weapons, armor and tools from the resources they mine. They could be particularly skilled in creating sharp, small and agile weapons, like knives, short swords, and javelins.
-   Goblins could also craft traps, mechanical devices, and other items that could be useful for survival and hunting in the Underdark.
-   They might also trade food, such as mushrooms, fungi, and other subterranean plants and animals if they have found a way to cultivate them or hunt them.
-   Goblins could also act as guides for other Underdark dwellers and traders since they know the underground terrain well.

using all of the above information can you create important goblin NPCs? I would like a mixture of helpful and hostile NPCs. Some Ideas are a curious goblin explorer, that can act as a guide and sherpa for the players.

Sure, I can create important goblin NPCs for your fantasy MMORPG using the information provided. Here are a few examples of goblin NPCs that could be a mixture of helpful and hostile:

1.  Gribble: A goblin explorer who is fascinated by the ancient civilization that the town of Hardrun is built on top of. He is willing to act as a guide and sherpa for the players, leading them through the ancient ruins and providing information about the civilization. However, he is also quite greedy and may demand a high fee for his services.
    
2.  Skarg: A goblin blacksmith who runs a shop in the town of Hardrun. He is skilled in crafting weapons and armor and is willing to trade with the players. However, he is also fiercely competitive and may try to undercut other merchants in the town.
    
3.  Krog: A goblin chieftain who leads a tribe of goblins living in the Underdark. He is hostile to outsiders but may be willing to make a deal with the players if they can offer him something of value. He is a strong and ruthless leader, but also a shrewd bargainer.
    
4.  Gromm: A goblin scout who is hired by the town guard to patrol the mine's tunnels and provide intel on the goblin infestation. He is brave and resourceful and may be willing to join the player's party as a companion if they can prove their worth.
    
5.  Snikt: A goblin rogue who lives in the Underdark, and makes a living by looting and scavenging. He is hostile to outsiders but may be willing to make a deal with the players if they can offer him something of value. He is a skilled thief and has a good knowledge of the Underdark.
    

These are just a few examples of the goblin NPCs that you could create. I recommend giving them distinctive personalities, motivations, and backstory to make them more interesting. Remember you can adjust and develop them as you see fit to match the lore and atmosphere of your game. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

I'm thinking that goblins are not allowed in town at the start of the game. The players can either clear out the mines and kill all of the goblins or negotiate with them and share the mines. Rewrite the above characters to take account for this change.

Sure, I can rewrite the goblin NPCs to take account for the fact that goblins are not allowed in the town of Hardrun at the start of the game. Here's how the characters could be modified:

1.  Gribble: A goblin explorer who is fascinated by the ancient civilization that the town of Hardrun is built on top of. He lives in the Underdark and is not allowed in the town. The players could find him in the Underdark and he could offer to lead them through the ancient ruins and provide information about the civilization in exchange for help with the goblin infestation.
    
2.  Skarg: A goblin blacksmith who runs a shop in the Underdark. He is skilled in crafting weapons and armor and is willing to trade with the players. He could be a potential ally of the players and offer to help them negotiate with the goblin tribe in the mines in exchange for access to the town and its resources.
    
3.  Krog: A goblin chieftain who leads a tribe of goblins infesting one of the mines. He is hostile to outsiders and the players will have to face him and his tribe if they want to clear the mine. He could be a powerful boss in the game and a significant challenge to the players.
    
4.  Gromm: A goblin scout who lives in the Underdark, and makes a living by looting and scavenging. He is not allowed in the town, but could be willing to join the player's party as a companion if they can prove their worth. He could be a valuable asset to the players in the Underdark and in the mines as he has a good knowledge of the terrain.
    
5.  Snikt: A goblin rogue who lives in the Underdark, and makes a living by looting and scavenging. He is not allowed in the town, but could be willing to make a deal with the players if they can offer him something of value. He could be a valuable asset to the players in the Underdark and in the mines as he has a good knowledge of the terrain and could help them navigate the mines.
    

These are just a few examples of how the goblin NPCs could be modified to take account of the fact that goblins are not allowed in the town at the start of the game. The players can either clear out the mines and kill all of the goblins or negotiate with them and share the mines.

Can you describe the goblin social hierarchys?

Sure, I can describe the goblin social hierarchies in your fantasy world. Goblin societies are often portrayed as being hierarchical, with a clear chain of command and social stratification. Here are a few ideas to consider for how goblin social hierarchies might be organized:

-   The goblin society is likely to be led by a powerful chieftain or warlord, who commands the loyalty of the other goblins through a combination of strength, cunning, and fear. This leader would have a small group of elite warriors and advisors who would act as his loyal lieutenants.
    
-   Below the leader, there could be a hierarchy of goblin warriors and fighters, who would be responsible for defending the tribe and enforcing the leader's will. These goblin warriors would be skilled in combat and have a high status within the tribe.
    
-   The goblin society could also have a class of goblin craftsmen and artisans, who would be responsible for creating weapons, armor, and other items that the tribe needs to survive. These goblin craftsmen would have a higher status than the common goblins and could be rewarded with better living conditions and resources.
    
-   The goblin society could also have a class of goblin scouts and thieves, who would be responsible for finding food, resources and information. These goblin scouts and thieves would be skilled in stealth and survival, and would have a higher status than the common goblins.
    
-   The goblin society would also have a large number of common goblins, who would be responsible for performing the day-to-day tasks that keep the tribe running. These common goblins would have the lowest status within the tribe and would be the most expendable.
    
-   Some goblin societies could have a religious or spiritual leader, who would be responsible for interpreting the tribe's beliefs and customs and communicating with the goblin gods or ancestor's spirit. These goblin spiritual leaders could have a significant influence on the society and could be respected among the tribe.
    

Keep in mind that this is all fictional, and you can adjust and develop the goblin social hierarchies as you see fit to match the lore and atmosphere of your game. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Mordicai](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp4XhL0ZyQFknAh7t7yCiTnFd87nqm2d7CZd0a40%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

you mentioned an ancient religion earlier, let's expound on that idea. I'm thinking that all the different modern cultures of my world interpret the ancient religion in many different watered-down ways, but there are themes that are shared. Explain how the people of Hardrun interpret that vs how the goblins interpret it. The dwellers of the Underdark should have a shared religious theme and so should the Upworlders (the people that live on the surface).

Sure, I can expound on the idea of an ancient religion that is interpreted in different ways by the different cultures in your fantasy world. Here are a few ideas to consider for how the people of Hardrun and the goblins might interpret the ancient religion differently:

-   The people of Hardrun could have a more scholarly and intellectual interpretation of the ancient religion. They could have preserved ancient texts and artifacts, and have a deep understanding of the religion's history and teachings. They might have built temples, shrines and other places of worship, where people can go to pray and make offerings to the ancient gods.
    
-   The goblins, on the other hand, could have a more primal and animistic interpretation of the ancient religion. They could see the ancient gods as powerful spirits that inhabit the Underdark, and they may make offerings of food, blood, and other resources to appease these spirits. They could have a more ritualistic approach to the religion, with shamans or spiritual leaders performing ceremonies and sacrifices to honor the ancient gods.
    
-   The dwellers of the Underdark could have a shared religious theme as they are all living in the same harsh environment and would have to worship gods that can help them survive in the Underdark. They could have a similar approach to the goblins, with a more primal and animistic interpretation of the ancient religion, but with the addition of their own unique customs and beliefs.
    
-   The Upworlders, people that live on the surface, could have a more civilized interpretation of the ancient religion, having incorporated it into their daily lives, and with a more structured approach, like the people of Hardrun. They could have built grand temples and cathedrals dedicated to the ancient gods, with a more formalized system of priests and clerics who lead worship and perform ceremonies.
    

It's important to note that this is all fictional, and you can adjust and develop the way the different cultures interpret the ancient religion as you see fit to match the lore and atmosphere of your game. The important thing is to make the interpretations different and unique for each culture, but also have common themes that connect them all. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

I'm thinking the main goblin city is built around an ancient ziggurat. This ziggurat was built to study dark magic and demons by the ancients. I want the goblins and the denizens of the Underdark to have a secret knowledge that the Upworlders don't.

The idea of a goblin city built around an ancient ziggurat is an interesting one. The ziggurat, being an ancient structure, could hold a lot of significance for the goblins and other denizens of the Underdark. Here are a few ideas to consider for how the goblins and the denizens of the Underdark might use the ancient ziggurat and its secret knowledge of dark magic and demons:

-   The goblins could see the ziggurat as a sacred site, and the source of their power. They could have built their city around it, and use it as a center for religious and spiritual practices. They may believe that the ancient gods and spirits that inhabit the Underdark reside in the ziggurat and make offerings to them.
    
-   The ziggurat could contain ancient texts and artifacts that reveal secret knowledge of dark magic and demons. The goblins and other denizens of the Underdark could use this knowledge to gain an advantage over their enemies and other dangers of the Underdark. They could use this knowledge for rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices to appease the spirits or demons that live in the Underdark, which in return would give them some sort of powers or protection.
    
-   The goblins and other denizens of the Underdark could use the ziggurat as a place of worship and a source of power. They could have secret ceremonies and rituals that only they know about and that give them powers that the Upworlders don't have. They could use this knowledge to communicate with demons and other dark entities that inhabit the Underdark to gain an advantage in battle or in trade.
    
-   The goblin city built around the ancient ziggurat could be a source of fear and fascination for other Underdark dwellers, which could make them respect and fear the goblins. It could also be an important site for pilgrimage for people who want to access the ancient knowledge and the power it holds.
    

Keep in mind that this is all fictional, and you can adjust and develop the goblin city and the ancient ziggurat as you see fit to match the lore and atmosphere of your game. The important thing is to make the ancient ziggurat and the knowledge it holds unique and different from what the Upworlders know, this would make the goblins and the denizens of the Underdark a more mysterious and powerful culture. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2730%27%20height=%2730%27/%3e)![Mordicai](https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAEdFTp4XhL0ZyQFknAh7t7yCiTnFd87nqm2d7CZd0a40%3Ds96-c&w=64&q=75)

I want to make this city more interesting. I think all Underdark denizens are welcome in the city but not in the Ziggurat itself unless they are invited. Can you describe what this city looks like? and give me a list of names?

Sure, I can describe what the goblin city built around the ancient ziggurat might look like and give you a list of names for different locations within the city. Here are a few ideas to consider:

-   The city could be built into the natural caverns and tunnels of the Underdark, with the ziggurat at its center. The ziggurat could be an imposing structure, made of ancient stones and adorned with carvings and symbols that depict the ancient gods and demons. The city could be built around the base of the ziggurat, with tunnels and tunnels of goblin-made homes, shops, and other buildings carved into the surrounding rock.
    
-   The city could have different districts, each with its own unique character and purpose. For example, there could be a marketplace district, where merchants from all over the Underdark come to trade goods. There could also be a residential district, where the goblin citizens live and a district for the goblin's craftsmen and artisans.
    
-   The city could be well-fortified, with gates, walls, and guard towers to protect it from the dangers of the Underdark. The city could also have a system of tunnels and secret passages that lead to the ziggurat, which only the goblin leaders and their guests are allowed to use.
    
-   The city could be dimly lit, with torches and lanterns providing the only source of light. The city could also have some areas that are completely dark, where only the goblin scouts and thieves can navigate.
    

Here are some name ideas for different locations within the city:

-   The Ziggurat of the Ancient Gods
-   The Cavern of the Dark Arts
-   The Market of the Underdark
-   The Residential Tunnels
-   The Forging District
-   The Stonework District
-   The Walled City
-   The Black Gate
-   The Guard Tower
-   The Secret Passages

Keep in mind that this is all fictional, and you can adjust and develop the city as you see fit to match the lore and atmosphere of your game. The important thing is to make the city unique, mysterious and interesting for the players to explore. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

Why might the people of the Underdark not like the Upworlders and vice versa?

There could be a variety of reasons why the people of the Underdark might not like the Upworlders and vice versa. Here are a few ideas to consider:

-   One reason might be a lack of understanding or knowledge about the other culture. The people of the Underdark might see the Upworlders as unfamiliar and strange, and may have misconceptions or stereotypes about them. Similarly, the Upworlders might not understand the customs or beliefs of the people of the Underdark, and may view them with suspicion or fear.
    
-   Another reason might be a history of conflict or competition. The people of the Underdark might see the Upworlders as rivals for resources or territory. The Upworlders might view the people of the Underdark as a threat to their safety or way of life. This could result in a long-standing feud between the two groups.
    
-   A different reason could be the way of life of each culture. The people of the Underdark might see the Upworlders as wasteful, frivolous and weak, while the Upworlders might see the people of the Underdark as primitive, savage and uneducated.
    
-   Another reason could be related to religion. The Upworlders might see the people of the Underdark's way of worshiping their gods as dark or evil, while the people of the Underdark might see the Upworlders' way of worshiping as weak or misguided.
    
-   It could also be related to the political and economic situation. The Upworlders might see the people of the Underdark as a source of cheap labor, which they exploit for their own gain. On the other hand, the people of the Underdark might see the Upworlders as oppressors and exploiters, who take advantage of their resources and labor.
    
-   It could also be a combination of all the above reasons.![[Indicaza_DD_goblin_c255a63c-6b2a-4f8f-81b9-86a15bd99cb9.png]]
