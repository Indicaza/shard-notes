## **Elari (Mountain Guardians of Illothames)**

### **Origins:**
Hailing from the constellation of Lyria, the Elari, once known as the Starborn, were ethereal beings of pure energy, dancing amidst the stars. Witnessing the suffering and chaos in the universe, a faction among them chose to descend into the corporeal realm, hoping to combat the rising tide of evil and bring balance. This selfless act, however, came at a cost. These Elari lost their ethereal form, becoming bound to the physical realm, and were deemed "corrupted" by their celestial kin. They can never return to the astral plane, forever separated from their original state.

### **Settlement in Arcadia:**
Drawn to the majestic Celestia Peaks of Arcadia, they established the city of Illothames atop the Grey Rise mountains. The Thames river, a life-giving force, flows through their city, cascading down the mountainside, symbolizing the Elari's own descent from the stars.

### **Culture & Lifestyle:**
- **Organic Architecture:** The Elari have a unique connection to the natural world. They grow their homes, tools, art, and temples from the living environment around them. Powerful monks can shape trees, metals, earth, and crystals with mere thought, giving their creations an organic, flowing aesthetic.

- **Longevity:** The Elari live longer than any other race in Arcadia. Their perception of time is different, leading them to approach life with patience and deliberation. They are never in a rush, believing that every action should be purposeful and meaningful.

- **Reproduction:** Due to their extended lifespans, the Elari have a prolonged gestation period and raising an offspring takes around a century. Young Elari undergo a tumultuous puberty that lasts for decades, filled with heightened emotions and impulsiveness.

- **Youth and Elders:** The elder Elari, valuing order and tranquility, often keep their young cloistered, partly out of a sense of protection and partly due to the embarrassment caused by the unpredictable nature of their youth.

- **Spiritual Practices:** Despite their separation from the astral plane, the Elari are deeply spiritual. They often meditate, gazing at the stars with a mix of longing and sorrow, remembering their ethereal origins and mourning their lost connection.

### **Pollentia and the Elari:**
In Pollentia, a small group of Elari act as ambassadors, ensuring that their culture and interests are represented. While they coexist peacefully with other races, they maintain their distinct customs and often reside in elevated areas, reminiscent of their mountain homes.

### **History with Arcadia:**
The Elari's history in Arcadia is marked by their dedication to combating evil and preserving the balance of the world. While they have mostly remained neutral in larger conflicts, they have intervened when the balance of nature and the universe was at stake. Their primary concern is the preservation of their culture, the memories of their celestial origins, and the protection of the sacred resources they guard.

The Elari's decision to become corporeal beings and fight against the forces of evil is both their strength and their tragedy. They stand as guardians, forever committed to their chosen path, even as they yearn for the astral light they once knew. In the silent moments atop the Grey Rise mountains, one can hear the soft, melancholic songs of the Elari, a lament for the stars.
